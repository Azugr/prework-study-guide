# Prework Study Guide Webpage
 
## Description

My motivation for this project was to improve my website, ayudarenal.com, and make it more personalized to better serve my patients. I wanted to create an interactive platform where I could provide valuable resources and information.

I built this project to enhance my skills in web development, enabling me to create a more dynamic and engaging website.

This project solves the problem of creating a static, less engaging website. By making the site interactive, I can offer real-time resources, personalized content, and tools that my patients can use to better manage their health. 

I gained a deeper understanding of how to create a user-friendly interface, manage content dynamically, and ensure that the website is both functional and visually appealing.
